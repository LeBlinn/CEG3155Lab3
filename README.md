This is the repo for Lab 3 of Digital systems 2

The main objective of this laboratory was to design and build in a sequential state machine in vhdl.
The state machine is meant to control a traffic light.

Please note that these are only the vhdl files.
In order to try our lab you will have to compile the project yourself.
